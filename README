=About=

Stream of Consciousness is a complete system for managing a blog and/or personal website.  It's inspiration comes from Blosxom, and I have tried to stay true to the spirit of that excellent software.  Stream of Conscioussness is filesystem based (in fact, can be used as a drop-in replacement for a blosxom blog), and can run your entire site with just 1 file.  

=Key features=

*  Blogging - Its main purpose.  Makes it simple to maintain a blog.  Filesystem based storage lets you edit your posts in whatever editor you want.  Your categories are subdirectories, so you have the ability to create new ones on the fly.

* Static content pages - Perfect for an "About me" page or anything else you might want to post

* Robust plugin support - You can create plugins to change nearly anything with ease

* Simple template support - Create a new theme with just a few tags

* Simplicity - Instead of an enourmous CMS just to write a blog,  Stream of Consciousness is a simple ~400 line Ruby script which can run on nearly any platform with ease.
