Stream of Consciousness - Blogging Minimilism

* About

So why another piece of blog software?  Well,  I've been blogging 
for years now, no software package worked exactly how I wanted.

Blosxom was close,  actually pretty near perfect, and there's no good
reason I could not have used it really.  I'm a programmer by nature
and I love Ruby, so I decided to write my own clone in Ruby.  While it's
been done,  various clones did not capture the spirit of Blosxom in my 
opinion.

Blosxom got a lot right in my opinion, the program was a single script, 
and it used the filesystem as a database.  Keeping those key points in 
mind, I wrote Stream of Consciousness.

SOC currently lacks many of Blosxom's features such as static pages
and plugins.  There is also no easy themeing system, but it is possible
with subclassing.  Static pages are nearly working, and plugins will
be in there eventually (when I need them)

* Setup

SOC requires eRuby installed, I currently run it under mod_ruby, but
cgi should work just as well.  Use google to help you get that setup.

At the beginning of the source file you will see a hash of settings 
which are commented (options and comments copied from Blosxom).

You can also pass the same hash to the Class when you initialize it.
This is the preferred method as it prevents you from changing the 
actual source code in the even you want to upgrade when new versions
are released.

the dispatch method gets everything rolling after it is initialized.


* Changelog
