* About

So why another piece of blog software?  Well,  I've been blogging 
for years now, no software package worked exactly how I wanted.

Blosxom was close,  actually pretty near perfect, and there's no good
reason I could not have used it really.  I'm a programmer by nature
and I love Ruby, so I decided to write my own clone in Ruby.  While it's
been done,  various clones did not capture the spirit of Blosxom in my 
opinion.

Blosxom got a lot right in my opinion, the program was a single script, 
and it used the filesystem as a database.  Keeping those key points in 
mind, I wrote Stream of Consciousness.

SOC currently lacks many of Blosxom's features such as static pages
and plugins.  There is also no easy themeing system, but it is possible
with subclassing.  Static pages are nearly working, and plugins will
be in there eventually (when I need them)
